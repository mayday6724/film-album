        <h2>Hi There! I'm Iris</h2>
        <p>I'm currently learning to live an essentialist life, inspired by the book <i>Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</i>.  
            This album accidentally became a practice of essentialism because only 27 films were contained in a FUJI quick-snap flash camera. Shootings are all determined since it’s surely a YES to the question “Whether it's THE pleasant moment I'd like to recall afterward?". I experienced the wisdom of selection and would like to share it with those who may be concerned. Hope you enjoy my work and pursue your LESS too! :)
